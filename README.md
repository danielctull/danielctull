Hello there! I'm Daniel.

I make a lot of random repositories on here and they're vaguely sorted using organisations.

* 💻 [Apps](https://github.com/danielctull-apps): Little apps and command line tools.
* 🛹 [Playground](https://github.com/danielctull-playground): Experimental projects and things I've played with.
* 📝 [Tests](https://github.com/danielctull-tests): Small projects to test the functionality of things.
* 🍏 [Feedback](https://github.com/danielctull-feedback/): Projects for "Feedbacks" I've filed with Apple.
